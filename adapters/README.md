# Trailblazer Adapters

## Adding a new protocol adapter

### 1. Add your project under `adapters/projects`

### 2. Write an indexer in the new folder

An example adapter for tracking OrderFulfilled Event on the OKX marketplace can be seen [here](./projects/okx/order_fulfilled.go)

### 3. Test out the adapter by adding it to the cli

An example on how to add a new adapter to the cli is [here](../cmd/README.md)

### 4. Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch. Provide a clear description of the changes and the protocol added.

### 5. Review and Merge

Wait for the PR to be reviewed by the maintainers. Once approved, your changes will be merged, and the protocol info will be added to trailblazers.
